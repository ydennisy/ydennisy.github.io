GZIP provides lossless compression, which in essence means we can recover the original data when decompressing it. It is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, a combination of LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding.

### LZ77 Algorithm

The LZ77 algorithm simply replaces repeated occurences of the data with references to the original.

### Huffman Coding
