### Welcome to my personal site.

Currently I live in London where I am the Associate Product Director for an Ad Tech company called Media IQ. At my day job I build big data applications which deliver both insights and ROI to our customers.

By night, I love to learn, hack and dream up new business ideas.

The purpose of this site is mainly educational as I find writing about any topics which you have studied in depth helps to cement the knowledge in the brain.
